# Build a KiCad app (pcbnew, eeschema, calculator) inside Docker, then run
# the ENV shim on the host.

#   ./docker/build.sh <app>[,<app>...] [args...]
#
# Apps:
#   kicad_editor   merged PCB + schematic editor image — serves all four editors
#                  (PCB / Footprint / Schematic / Symbol) via runtime --frame
#   calculator     PCB calculator
#   pl_editor      drawing-sheet editor
#   gerbview       Gerber viewer
#   all            build the deployed product (pcbnew only)
#   pcbnew         standalone PCB engine (debug aid; not deployed — kicad_editor is)
#   eeschema       standalone schematic engine (debug aid; not deployed)
#
# A comma-separated list builds just those apps in order (e.g.
# "calculator,pl_editor" — used to exercise the multi-app path cheaply).
#
# Any extra args are forwarded to scripts/kicad/build-<app>.sh (e.g. -j 8,
# --full, --release, --diag=gal).
#
# The build is split into two phases:
# 1. Docker: Compile KiCad to WASM (fully finalized; JSPI links in-container)
# 2. Host: ENV merge shim on the glue (patch-env-shim.mjs)

# Auto-launch the live progress dashboard in this terminal (handled by logging.sh,

# launched, in the pre-re-exec process.
